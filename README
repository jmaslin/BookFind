BookFind

Find PDFs for specific classes, or upload them (and vote if valid).

Requirements:

- User accounts based on .edu emails.
  - Based on email, allowed to access University-specific classes.
    - v1 just for Drexel
- Uploaded books will be tagged based on associated classes, book name, ISBN, edition, etc.
  - Look into the legality of hosting books
- Users can mark PDF as helpful, spam/other, used in X class (select from list)
- Search by class name, subject, or book
- Uploading a (verified) PDF gives you credit
  - Verified: moderator approved or voted on >5 times + valid
- Approved community moderators or uploaders (ie. once 2+ verified PDFs, future uploads do not need as much verification, or higher disapproving marking ratio to be removed. Instead of 25% voting its bad, make it 50%.)
  - Imp. to note that bad and no longer irrelevant are separate.
    - If voted irrelevant, still avail, but notice that X class/professor does not accept it.

Priority List (Simplify)

- Design
- Implement
- Laravel

Monetization Ideas:

- View eBooks from any school.
- Unlimited views / downloads.
- Alerts
- Link to Amazon copy.


To Implement:

- Searchbar across nav - universal (class) 
- if LIKE existing long names or match shortcode

- Better registration page
 - Feedback for e-mails (live alert if not valid)
 - Alert if first person for school / class (fun)

- Way to see all the books a user from same school has uploaded
  - Can still keep anonymous

- Ratio of students requesting to no book available
  - Display on homepage, suggest if able to upload (or email someone who they know has it)

 - Way to add books to the class even if there is no link
  - Books (name, isbn) -> Book versions (book_id, url)

 - When adding classes, if no book for that class, request they add the isbn/book name ?

 - If another school has same ISBN, list it but say was added by someone outside school

 - Two step feedback process
   - Step 1: vote up/down
   - Step 2: choose feedback code - prexisting ("wrong version", "spam", "bad name" "other")

 - Hook into a storage site api (ie. mediafire) so users can upload PDFs
 	on their own devices + the site still doesn't have to store it.

Fancy in way, way future: 

- Use schools color scheme as custom view
