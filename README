BookFind

Find PDFs for specific classes, or upload them (and vote if valid).

Requirements:

- User accounts based on .edu emails.
  - Based on email, allowed to access University-specific classes.
    - v1 just for Drexel
- Uploaded books will be tagged based on associated classes, book name, ISBN, edition, etc.
  - Look into the legality of hosting books
- Users can mark PDF as helpful, spam/other, used in X class (select from list)
- Search by class name, subject, or book
- Uploading a (verified) PDF gives you credit
  - Verified: moderator approved or voted on >5 times + valid
- Approved community moderators or uploaders (ie. once 2+ verified PDFs, future uploads do not need as much verification, or higher disapproving marking ratio to be removed. Instead of 25% voting its bad, make it 50%.)
  - Imp. to note that bad and no longer irrelevant are separate.
    - If voted irrelevant, still avail, but notice that X class/professor does not accept it.
